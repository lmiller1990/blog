<h1>Gene Calling in Viruses</h1>
<p><em>Gene Calling</em> is a fancy way of saying "this region of DNA corresponds to a gene". This is usually done with computational models, using heuristics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>open reading frames (ORFs)</li>
<li>start / stop codons</li>
<li>ribosome binding sites</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing so in viruses is particularly tricky for many reasons, one of which is <strong>overlapping ORFs</strong>. For example, you might have a DNA strand:</p>
<pre><code>AUG AAT AUG GAG ATG UGA UAA

AUG AAT AUG GAG ATG UGA
^^^                 ^^^
start               end 

**OR**

AUG AAT AUG GAG ATG UGA UAA
    ^^^                 ^^^
    start               end 
</code></pre>
<p>Both are valid ORFs, depending where transcription starts. Viruses pack a whole lot into their genome. They are very efficient.</p>
